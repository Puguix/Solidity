# Solidity

A small project in solidity to learn the langage and various small challenges to dig more into the langage and its applications.

The first course: https://cryptozombies.io/

The challenges: https://speedrunethereum.com/

For the challenges, you need to:

```
yarn install
```

And then in 3 different terminals, for front-end, back-end, and contract:

```
yarn start
```

```
yarn chain
```

```
yarn deploy
```

To update the contract:

```
yarn deploy --reset
```

And maybe modify in the code the local address so it matches yours on the front-end
